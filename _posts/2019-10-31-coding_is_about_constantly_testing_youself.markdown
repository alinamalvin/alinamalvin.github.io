Hi everyone,

I am Alina and I will be sharing my path on exploring coding in this blog. 
Programming is something completely new to me. I had a law degree from Russia and I currently work as property manager in NYC for last 2.5 years.
Though I do enjoy working in real estate, I never felt this is my dream job. While I do enjoy helping people to find their homes and live there happily, I always wanted to have a more logical, technical occupation. Also my dream is to be able to travel the world for a few years while working remotely. 
Because of the above a few months ago I started to think what I can be good at and what job might meet my needs and interests. After thinking of many different jobs and possible career paths it stroke me that I can find it interesting to work on computers and do something related to programming. I have always enjoyed numbers, formulas and working with other trechnical information and data. 
Though I never had any background in programming (except the high school where I took some basic programming classes, where we studied Pascal), I decided to give it a shot. I took a free Bootcamp Prep course at Flatiron just to see how it is going. While it was quite challenging, I truely enjoyed to constantly face challenges and solving the problems. Honestly, I was thrilled to bits every time the test finally passed (though often I needed a few hours to figure out why it is not running).  I did rely on google a lot, but I found it very helpful. 
After completing the Bootcamp Prep I was convineced that I should sign up for Software Engineering Course, because it might turn out to a job of my dream some day. 

Cheers,
Alina
