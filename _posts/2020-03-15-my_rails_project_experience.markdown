Hi everyone,

I just finished my Rails project and I feel very accomplished. Three projects behind and I finally started to feel like I develop a bit of "programmer mindset". With previous projects, every single bug my app had to make my heart sink and gave me anxiety. When I saw an error I already imagined a few hours of trying to figure out what the problem is and another couple of days to figure out how to fix it. However this time it is different. I am not scared anymore of seeing an error. Moreover, I feel sort of excited. It is a very similar feeling to the one you have on the roller-coast- you are scared, but you are awaiting for the adrenaline release in your body once it is over. Same here: when I see an error now I am no longer scared, but excited to figure out and learn new things.

I will share some steps that helped me to approach the problems with the right mindset:
1) Dont panic if you an error! You probably have seen it a hundred times throughout the course, but I cant stress it enough. Programming work includes parts: building code and debugging it. It is a normal process and no programmer in the world doesnt get an error in his code. 

2) This step is very important: try to find the reason for the error. You have to read the error message very carefully - Ruby always gives you a pretty straightforward hint. I think reading an error message correctly is 70% of the problem-solving.

3) If you use a search engine to find an answer- use the search requests and words combination correctly. If you describe your problem too precisely, it might not find an answer for you since no one might have the exact problem as you before. However, if you make a too broad search, it might give you too many answers that even are not related to your problem. Try to be specific, and choose words carefully so the returned results will help you to identify the solution or at least give a hint in the right direction.

4) Look out for help! Use all available sources. It is not only useful because someone can try to lead you in the right direction, but also because when you start to describe your problem in writing, the puzzle often becomes a clear picture in your head and your find a solution yourself. It happened to me very often.

5) Be kind to yourself and take a break. I know how hard it is to stop working on the problem and leave it unsolved. However, it is crucial to take a break (even for a day or two if times allow) to give yourself rest and come back to the problem with a fresh mind. Believe me, the solution will find itself unexpectedly as long as you keep trying!

Best of luck,
Alina
